# modular-arithmetic
An attempt to implement basic modular arithmetic library (and some stuff from number theory) in educational purposes.
## Features:
* supporting every numeric type with generics
* solving linear congruences when there are one solution
* finding inverse
* raising to non-negative exponent
* gcd and euler function
* tests

## Non-features, bugs and TODO:
* negative exponentiation
* solving congruences with more than one solution
* fix all that mess with initNegative and initPositive
* maybe add some Millerâ€“Rabin primality test to get prime numbers?

## How to get anything?
Just clone it with git and type ```zig build test```
